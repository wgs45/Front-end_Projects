        <h3 id="headline">Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Early Life</strong> - Approximately a millenium ago, Frieren
            was born and raised in an elven village, where she was notably the
            most powerful amongst the residents...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beyond Journey's End Arc</strong> - After at least 900 years
            of life, Frieren was recruited by the Hero Himmel and joined the
            Hero Party as its Mage, where they journeyed alongside Priest Heiter
            and Warrior Eisen to the Demon King's Castle in Ende in order to
            defeat the Demon King...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Frieren has an easy-going personality, however, her aloof attitude
          makes her a mystery to her peers, as humans and elves tend to see
          things differenty.
